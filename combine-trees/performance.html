        <h2>Online BST vs. Offline BST</h2>
        <p>
            Throughout this report, I will continue to mention online and offline BSTs and there is an important distinction.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>For a sequence of seaches in a BST:</b>
        </p>

        <p>An <i>offline</i> BST is able to perform the searches as a function of the the entire access sequence.
           In other words, the BST is constructed with knowledge of the entire sequence and the best possible performing tree is made.
        </p>

        <p>An <i>online</i> BST is able to perform each searches as a function of all the searches that came before.
            The BST is initially constructed with no knowledge of the sequence, then is able to adjust the BST as
            each access is made.

        <h2>C-competitive Binary Search Tree</h2>
        <p>For an access sequence <i>X</i> there exists an offline BST that can perform it optimally.
            The number of unit cost of operations performed by this BST is <i>OPT(X)</i>. An <i>online</i>
            BST is C-competitive if it can perform <i>X</i> in at most <i>C*OPT(X)</i>. An online BST that is
            O(1)-Competitive is called <i>dynamically optimal</i>.
