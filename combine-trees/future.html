        <h1>Future Work</h1>
        <p>
            This publication has a rich set of theorms and proofs of algorithms and is at a level that I've never read fully before.
            It was difficult so there are a few details and parts I wasn't sure about and still have questions. There is much
            future work to be done!

        <h2> Questions </h2>
        <p>
            Some questions have built up over the course of this project. Here are a few of them!
            If you actually know the answer feel free to address them in the issue section on this <a href="https://github.com/Abdisalan/abdisalan.github.io/issues"> github page</a>.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>How does the running time result in <i>O(1)-competitive</i> with the best BSTs?</li>
            <li> Why don't slower BSTs ruin the performance?</li>
            <li> Is <i>O(n logn)</i> worth having an access time of <i>O(log log n)?</i>
        </ul>

        <h2> Disclaimer </h2>
        <p>
            This work needs verification. It was studied to the best of my abilities
            but since this work is very complex I may have missed or misinterpreted
            critical ideas. If you detect any issues, please feel free to write an
            issue on the <a href="https://github.com/Abdisalan/abdisalan.github.io/issues" github page</a> for this site.
