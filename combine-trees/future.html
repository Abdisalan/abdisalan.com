        <p>
            This publication has a rich set of theorms and proofs of algorithms and is at a level that I've never read fully before.
            It was difficult so there are a few details and parts I wasn't sure about and still have questions. There is much
            future work to be done!

        <p>
            This work needs verification. It was studied to the best of my abilities
            but since this work is very complex I may have missed or misinterpreted
            critical ideas. If you detect any issues, please feel free to write an
            issue on the github page for this site.
