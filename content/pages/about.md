Welcome to my corner of the internet!

My name is Abdisalan Mohamud and I'm a software engineer.

Quick Fun Facts:
- I have a YouTube where I teach you how to do some programming projects
- I'm a black belt in Shotokan Style Karate
- I have 13 brothers and sisters

I went to Tufts University and got a degree in Computer Science. I currently work at [Ohm Connect](https://ohmconnect.com) remotely while living in sunny Boulder, Colorado.

I used to work as a full stack engineer but lately I've been focusing more on my backend skills. I'm currently studying Systems Design and learning how to better work on a fully remote team!

Outside of work, I'm either spending time with friends, occasionally running/training for a race, or playing video games. I also like writing (check out the blog!) about functional programming, SQL, or random topics.

It's taken a lot of help to get where I am in my career and I want to give back! So expect to see some programming tutorials here or on my Youtube channel in the future.

Stay fresh,

Abdi
