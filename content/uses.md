My work setup is pretty simple with one exception -- the holy grail of keyboards, the kinesis advantage 2.

## Hardware
- Dell 32" 4k Monitor -- Gives good space and is pretty but maybe too big lol
- Thinkpad X1 Carbon -- Pretty good at running chrome where I run all my programs in the cloud ðŸ˜…
- âœ¨Silverâœ¨ Kinesis Advantage 2 -- The best keyboard on earth

## Software
- Emacs org-mode for note taking & second brain
- VS Code for coding
- Every thing is in the browser anyway
