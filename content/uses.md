What I use at work on a day to day basis, changes from time to time but I'll try to keep this up to date.

## Hardware
- 2x Dell 27" Monitor: U2719D -- give lots of real estate to write code!
- 2018 Macbook Pro 15" -- absolute beast in handling workloads
- Apple Magic Keyboard
- Apple Magic TrackPad 2
- Rain Design mStand Laptop Stand

## Software
- Notion ❤️ -- manages all my notes and projects
- VS Code (vim-mode)
- iTerm2
- Postman -- testing API endpoints
- headspace -- meditation app
- LastPass -- password manager
- NordVPN -- awesome VPN!

## Coming Soon 👨🏾‍🏭
Soon, I'll add my home setup, which is much more interesting, so stay tuned!
